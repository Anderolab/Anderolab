# Behavioral and Calcium Imaging Analysis Pipeline for Stress-induced Mice üêÅ

This repository provides a pipeline to analyze data related to the behavior and calcium imaging of mice subjected to stressors. The experimental design explores a fear acquisition and extinction paradigm based on the association of a shock and a tone. This is subsequently followed by the sole presentation of the tone for the fear extinction phase.

## Features

- **Behavioral Data Analysis**: Includes tools to process and analyze the animals' behavior, particularly focusing on freezing behaviors.

- **Calcium Imaging Data Processing**: Essential tools to process and analyze the fluorescent calcium traces captured during the experiment.

- **Stressor Data**: Comprehensive analysis methods to process data concerning stressors, involving both movement and calcium aspects.

- **Neural Response Analysis**: Advanced utilities designed to group and differentiate neural response types using various clustering techniques and correlation coefficients.

## Repository Structure
